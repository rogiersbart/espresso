::: {.notes}
This project is basically a continuation of [my Inktober 2019
adventure](https://twitter.com/rogiersbart/status/1190042707080691713), with a
somewhat expanded toolset, but still with coffee and ink as the main medium. I
use a Moleskine Pocket Watercolor Notebook now, and this website is basically a
digital copy of it. The source files are 1200 dpi scans, with minimal editing to
get rid of the page boundaries etc. This should allow experimenting with larger
prints in due time, as I love the textures I obtain here, and would love to see
what they do at a larger scale. Hope you enjoy these pages as much as I enjoy
creating them!
