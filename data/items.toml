description = " This project is basically a continuation of my Inktober 2019 adventure (see link to Twitter thread below), with a somewhat expanded toolset, but still with coffee and ink as the main medium. I use a Moleskine Pocket Watercolor Notebook now, and this website is basically a digital copy of it. The source files are 1200 dpi scans, with minimal editing to get rid of the page boundaries etc. This should allow experimenting with larger prints in due time, as I love the textures I obtain here, and would love to see what they do at a larger scale. Hope you enjoy these pages as much as I enjoy creating them!<br><a href='https://twitter.com/rogiersbart/status/1190042707080691713'>The Twitter thread</a> "

description = " Old camera. Trying 3-point perspective here, but didn't really think it through. Got 'How to draw' from Scott Robertson and Thomas Bertling for Christmas, so that should improve in time I guess. Also first time I am really not satisfied with the scan quality. Colour has been an issue from the start, but clearly light watery washes (top right) do not get digitized very well ... <br>Photo reference - pixabay.com/photos/1149767. "

Contrary to both of his paintings, she is depicted here with a twig of rosemary, which is often associated with positive effects on memory. <br>Photo reference - artsandculture.google.com/asset/EAH009jkJzYVMw.

description = " How to balance social distancing vs social contact? Something on the minds of people all around the globe most of this year. The ripples are a metaphor for the different waves we experienced, and the ones that are probably still to come. The nakedness refers to the fact that everybody is affected by this global health crisis. The crossed fingers refer to the failed leadership in many places, which makes some people can only hope for the best. First time using some splatter here. Also love the result of pencil + coffee only (no ink) for the bodies. "
