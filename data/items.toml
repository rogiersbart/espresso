description = " This project is basically a continuation of my Inktober 2019 adventure (see link to Twitter thread below), with a somewhat expanded toolset, but still with coffee and ink as the main medium. I use a Moleskine Pocket Watercolor Notebook now, and this website is basically a digital copy of it. The source files are 1200 dpi scans, with minimal editing to get rid of the page boundaries etc. This should allow experimenting with larger prints in due time, as I love the textures I obtain here, and would love to see what they do at a larger scale. Hope you enjoy these pages as much as I enjoy creating them!<br><a href='https://twitter.com/rogiersbart/status/1190042707080691713'>The Twitter thread</a> "
